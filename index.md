## Overview 

Finding a toilet on campus that has a good clean to closeness ratio is always a lone struggle we studdents face each semester. We'd like to make this journey more collaborative by creating a social media web app where students are able to find nearest bathrooms to their location. 

The app will also allow students to rate a bathroom's cleanliness level and include things that others can be weary of. For example, the quality of soap in the bathroom, number of stalls, business at times of days, availability of female products, or if there are areas designated for users to place their belongings while using the premises.


## Mockup page ideas

After registering and signing in, users are able to gain access to the following content:
- **[Homepage](https://manoa-bathroom-finder.site/)**: A random bathroom of the day will be featured based on user ratings.

- **[Profile](https://manoa-bathroom-finder.site/profile)**: Each user will have their own profile page which will show their bathroom reviews.

- **[Bathroom Directory](https://manoa-bathroom-finder.site/directory)**: A user can find the highest rating bathrooms near their location by choosing a UH Manoa buildling within the directory. Time pending, we will implement an algorithm to find the nearest bathrooms to a user based on their location. Bathroom directories will be organized by building and floor number. If a building or bathroom is not on the directory, users are able to add their own to the database with a submission form which automatically updates database.

- **[Rating Page](https://manoa-bathroom-finder.site/rating)**: Each bathroom will have a page which shows all ratings and reviews by other students. On this page a user can rate a bathroom and input their own reviews which will automatically be added to the rating page.

- **[Add Bathroom Page](https://manoa-bathroom-finder.site/add-bathroom)**:A seperate way to add a bathroom if the user does not want to use the profile table.
